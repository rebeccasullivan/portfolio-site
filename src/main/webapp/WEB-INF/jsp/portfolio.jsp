			</div>
			<p>Ever sit on a conference call all day, twiddling your thumbs, wishing there was something better to do with your time?
			Buzzword Bingo comes in to save the day. The final goal of this project is to create an app where colleagues can log in to 
			a game to play in real-time with a customized list of buzzwords. MVP is done, where boards are generated from seed data
			in a SQLite database. The app is my first foray into Node.js and SQLite, along with reinforcing some skills in vanilla 
			JavaScript and, eventually, AJAX.

			<h2>Tech Elevator &mdash; National Parks Web App</h2>	
			<h3>Cleveland, OH (2016)</h3>
			
			<div class="logoBlock">

				<a href="https://github.com/rebeccasullivan/national-parks-redux">Source Code</a>
			</div>
			<p>The National Parks project served as the culmination of our study of server-side web 
			programming and database programming in Java. By creating a web app hooked up to a database that 
			captures National Park reservations and dynamically displays information about the parks, we tied together 
			what we had learned about MVC, HTML/CSS, Servlets, JSPs, relational schemas, SQL, data persistence 
			(using JDBC), and continued to reinforce object-oriented programming concepts.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>As a Java student at Tech Elevator (a coding bootcamp in Cleveland, OH), this was my first side project, 
			where I aimed to apply concepts we had learned in class to a different context. The key concepts I learned through
			this experiment included encapsulation and class modeling, plus a reinforcement of the fundamentals of object-oriented
			programming.</p>

			<h2>PS Lifestyle &mdash; Customer Journey Mapping</h2>	
			<h3>Cleveland, OH (2016)</h3>
			
			<div class="logoBlock">

			</div>
			
			<p>As Director of Marketing, I led a team of 3 to create a strategy 
			for improving online sales of salon gift certificates for a company that operates salons 
			within retirement communities. We first charted the existing customer journey for a specific 
			target audience segment (adult children of community residents, who often make purchasing 
			decisions on behalf of their loved ones) and the ideal customer journey. Our team made 
			recommendations on a broad, strategic scale, and then broke them down into attainable, 
			tactical, short-term goals in the midst of a redesign of the company&#39;s online sales platform.

				<!-- <a href="#">Full Report</a> -->
			</div>
			<p>As part of a team of 4 in a Marketing Value Creation class, we developed 
			an overarching brand plan for an up-and-coming women&#39;s clothing retailer, based in LA. Our 
			final deliverable included an overview of the major industry factors influencing the company, 
			the brand&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, an analysis of the brand&#39;s major competitors, perceptual 
			mapping to determine ideal positioning, recommendations for new messaging, two target 
			audience personas along with a customer journey map for each, and our final brand-building recommendations.

			<h2>Weatherhead School of Management (CWRU) &mdash; Company Analysis and Valuation, Merck &amp; Co.</h2>	
			<h3>Cleveland, OH (2015)</h3>
			
			<div class="logoBlock">
				<img src="img/Merck-logo.png" />
			</div>
			<p>As part of a Corporate Reporting & Analysis class in the Accounting department, I 
			worked with 3 Masters of Accountancy students in providing a valuation for Merck & Co., a Fortune 500 
			pharmaceutical company. Our analysis started with broad strokes, including a dive into the business environment 
			and industry factors affecting the company. It then narrowed in on accounting ratio analysis and a comparative 
			performance assessment of the company&#39;s past 5-year financials. We developed various sales growth forecasting 
			scenarios and provided a few different valuations accordingly, including using the DCF method and residual earnings method.

			<h3>Cleveland, OH (2013)</h3>
			
			<div class="logoBlock">
				<img src="img/rpm-logo.jpg" />
			</div>
			<p>As part of a team of 5 Weatherhead MBA students, we performed an in-depth analysis and evaluation 
			of RPM International, a multinational holding company and manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. Our report 
			provided a forecasted valuation of the firm, based on a review of the company&#39;s history and its current state. The 
			financial analysis included a ratio analysis, net sales growth, and a qualitative analysis of the key influencing factors 
			on the firm&#39;s overall performance. We relied on historic financial data, investor relations and marketing materials, and 
			a meeting with a contact made at the firm.

				<img src="img/cfc-logo.png" />
			</div>
			<p>On a team of 3 as part of a Marketing for Nonprofit Organizations class and in tandem with my position 
			at ChamberFest Cleveland for their inaugural season, I worked to determine appropriate concept positioning to secure start-up 
			capacity building/venture funding for the festival&#39;s first season (in a test-market format), which launched in the summer of 2012.
